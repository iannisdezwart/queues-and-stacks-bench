# QueuesAndStacks Benchmark

Linked Lists vs Dynamic Arrays: Queues vs Stacks.

This benchmark compares the performance of a queue and a stack implemented
using linked lists and dynamic arrays.

Compile and run the benchmarks with `make && ./stack && ./queue`.
The programs will output graph data that contains the time taken to
push and pop items from the stack and queue using both linked lists
and dynamic array implementation.

These are the results I got on my 2015 Intel Core i5 MacBook Pro:
