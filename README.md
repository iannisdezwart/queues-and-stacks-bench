# QueuesAndStacks Benchmark

Linked Lists vs Dynamic Arrays: Queues vs Stacks
This benchmark compares the performance of a queue and a stack implemented
using linked lists and dynamic arrays.

Compile and run the benchmarks with `make && ./stack && ./queue`.
The programs will output graph data that contains the time taken to
push and pop items from the stack and queue using both linked lists
and dynamic array implementation.
